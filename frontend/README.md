# Dash frontend

This is the frontend for dash

TODO
- deploy
- add color maps
- add all functions
- fastapi-plotly-dash look into this so i can just put this dash route into the fastapi app.


So dash uses flask for its server backend so it uses gunicorn which is a WSGI (Web server gateway interface) and wont work with uvicorn a ASGI (async server gateway interface)
