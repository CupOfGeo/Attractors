# Attractors take 3


Hey so a long time ago i found this https://examples.holoviz.org/attractors/attractors.html project and thought it looked really cool so i played around with it and wanted to turn it into a rest api.

It going to make me pretty pictures and server as a good test service for other things.


going to learn to use the .devcontainers

so im now in a clean 3.11 dev container :) I have a bash terminal

Cool so i updated my pre-commit hooks as well

Im running without a vevn bc im already in a clean room


# Issues
- Termial auto complete
- Can't build or run Dockerfile in the container.

Maybe brew
